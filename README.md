# Sparkr [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rrrene/sparkr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rrrene/sparkr)

Sparkr is a port of [spark](https://github.com/holman/spark) for Ruby.

It lets you create ASCII sparklines for your Ruby CLIs: ▁▂▃▅▇



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sparkr'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sparkr



## Usage

### Shell

After installation, just run `sparkr` and pass it a list of numbers, like
you would with [spark](https://github.com/holman/spark). The output is what
you would expect:

    $ sparkr 0 30 55 80 33 150
    ▁▂▃▅▂▇

### Ruby

The real reason for this port:

    Sparkr.sparkline([0, 30, 55, 80, 33, 150])
    # => "▁▂▃▅▂▇"


### Coloring

Let's say you have your list of open and closed issues.

    list = [open_issue_count, closed_issue_count]
    Sparkr.sparkline(list)
    # => "▁█"

But now you want to format the sparkline so that the open issues are red
and the closed ones are green (to quickly see how you are doing).

Let's further suppose you use a gem that adds a `#color` method to `String`
for ANSI coloring, like
[Term::ANSIColor](https://github.com/flori/term-ansicolor).

    require 'term/ansicolor'
    class String
      include Term::ANSIColor
    end

    Sparkr.sparkline(list) do |tick, count, index|
      if index == 0
        tick.color(:red)
      else
        tick.color(:green)
      end
    end
    # => "▁█" (colored, trust me)

To see how this looks live and in full colour, take a look at
